# Eat-Da-Burger
Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. Each burger on the right side of the page has 2 buttons- `Reorder` and `X`(Delete) buttons. When a user clicks on `Reorder` button, the burger will be reordered and shown on the left side of the page. A click on `X` button will delete the burger.
